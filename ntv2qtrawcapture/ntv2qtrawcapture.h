	@page	ntv2qtrawcapture		NTV2QtRawCapture Demo

	This Qt-based GUI demonstration application captures (and previews) raw video from the AJA CION camera
	into DNG files on the host. It demonstrates...
	-	how to use the new NTV2_FBF_10BIT_RAW_YCBCR and NTV2_FBF_10BIT_RAW_RGB raw formats;
	-	how to use the AJARawPreviewWidget, a reusable Qt-based GUI element that displays realtime video
		that's been grabbed from an NTV2RawFrameGrabber object;
	-	how to use the NTV2RawFrameGrabber class, a QThread that captures a raw video stream from the AJA CION,
		and uses Qt signals to emit video frames.
