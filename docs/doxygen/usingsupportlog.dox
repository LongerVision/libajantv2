@section		usingsupportlog		‘supportlog’ Command-Line Utility


@par	Description

A command-line tool that generates a support log file that contains state information about the
device and driver for one or more AJA devices, and can optionally capture device SDRAM contents into
a separate binary dump file.


@par	Synopsis

\code{.sh}
	supportlog [OPTION...]
	  -d, --device=index#|serial#|model      Which device to use
	  -s, --stdout                           Dump to stdout instead of file?
      -r, --sdram                            Also dump device SDRAM to .raw file?
	  -v  --verbose                          Verbose mode?
	  -w  --wait=seconds                     Time to wait before capturing
	Help options:
	  -?, --help                             Show this help message
	      --usage                            Show brief usage message
\endcode

-	The executable is shipped pre-built with the SDK, and appears in the “<b>bin</b>” directory.
-	Source code is provided in the Linux SDK.



@par	Device Selection

By default, <b>supportlog</b> generates a support log for the first device found.
\code{.sh}
$ ./bin/supportlog
\endcode

This is no different than specifying device zero:
\code{.sh}
$ ./bin/supportlog  --device 0
\endcode

You can also specify a device by model name. For example, if a Kona4 was installed in the host system:
\code{.sh}
$ ./bin/supportlog  --device kona4
\endcode

You can also specify a device by serial number:
\code{.sh}
$ ./bin/supportlog  --device 00T12345
\endcode



@par	Log Files

Files are always written into the currently logged-in user’s home directory:
\code{.sh}
$ ls ~/*log
-rw-r--r--  1 demo  staff   130K Sep 20 15:53 /Users/demo/aja_supportlog_0_1537484005.log
-rw-r--r--  1 demo  staff   226K Sep 20 15:53 /Users/demo/aja_supportlog_1_1537484005.log
-rw-r--r--  1 demo  staff   272K Sep 20 15:53 /Users/demo/aja_supportlog_2_1537484005.log
\endcode

The name of the log file contains the device index number, and a 10-digit number that’s based on the date
and time it was generated. If the host file system enumerates files lexically by name, within a single device
index’s group, they should appear sorted oldest-to-newest.

To write a log file to a specific directory with a different name, use the “<tt>--stdout</tt>” option along
with standard shell redirection directives to pipe the output into the desired file and path:
\code{.sh}
$ ./bin/supportlog  --stdout  >./my_support_log.txt
\endcode



@par	Delaying Log Capture

Sometimes it’s desirable to capture the log after a certain length of time, often to give the operator time
to change something. Use the “<tt>--wait</tt>” option to specify a delay time.
For example, to capture a log after delaying 10 seconds:
\code{.sh}
$ ./bin/supportlog  --wait 10
\endcode



@par	Capturing Device SDRAM Contents

If AJA SDK Support requests a snapshot of the device’s SDRAM contents, use the “<tt>--sdram</tt>” option.

@note	The resulting dump file will be quite large. Be sure the host storage volume on which your home
		directory resides has plenty of free space.
