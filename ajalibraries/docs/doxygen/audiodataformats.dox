@section	audioformats	Audio Data Formats

Each Audio System on AJAâ€™s NTV2 devices support up to 8 or 16 audio channels.
(While some devices can be configured to support 6 channels, this may cause problems and should be avoided.)

The format of audio sample data in the host buffer exactly mirrors the format of audio sample data in the
Audio System's audio buffer in SDRAM on the device. See \ref audiooperation for more information.

@note	These formats apply even if the audio sample data is not PCM. See \ref audiooperation for more information about non-PCM audio.


@subsection	audfmt-singlech		Single-Channel Individual Audio Samples

Each single-channel audio sample requires exactly four bytes of storage.


@subsubsection	audfmt-24bit	24-Bit (HD) Audio

Only the upper (most-significant) 24 bits are used, as follows:

Note that when playing video from a host audio buffer that contains 32-bit audio samples, only the
most-significant 24 bits will end up in the transmitted audio packets. The least-significant 8 bits
from each 32-bit sample word in the host buffer are ignored.


@subsubsection	audfmt-20bit	20-Bit (SD) Audio

Only the upper (most-significant) 20 bits are used, as follows:

@image	html	fbf-20bitpcmaudio-75.png

Note that AJA devices don't support audio extended packets.
Thus, when capturing SD video that contains 24-bit audio, only the most-significant 20 bits will end up
in the captured samples in the host buffer.
Likewise, when playing SD video from a host audio buffer that contains 24-bit (or 32-bit) audio samples,
only the most-significant 20 bits will end up in the transmitted audio packets. The least-significant 12
bits from each 32-bit sample word in the host buffer are ignored.



@subsection	audfmt-6chan	6-Channel Mode

This format was used on older AJA devices, and is still provided for backward compatibility.

@note	6-Channel Mode is deprecated. Please avoid its use, even on older boards.



@subsection	audfmt-8chan	8-Channel Mode

The layout for two samples of 8-channel audio data is:

@image	html	fbf-8channelaudio-75.png

Within each 32-bit word, the 20/24-bit audio sample is left-justified identically to that of the 6-channel format.



@subsection	audfmt-16chan	16-Channel Mode

The layout for two samples of 16-channel audio data is:

@image	html	fbf-16channelaudio-75.png

Within each 32-bit word, the 20/24-bit audio sample is left-justified identically to that of the 6-channel format.
