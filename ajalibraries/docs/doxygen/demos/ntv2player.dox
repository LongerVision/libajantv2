@section	ntv2player		NTV2Player Demo

This command-line program plays out a repeating sequence of test patterns and audio tones with realtime timecode “burned”
into the video.

This is a typical WFM display showing the output of an AJA device that's connected to a host running <b>ntv2player</b>.
Note the timecode “burned” into the video test pattern and 8 channels of audio tone.

The NTV2Player class demonstrates…
-	how to generate a test pattern of a particular video geometry and get it into a frame buffer with the right format;
-	how to generate timecode and “burn” it into a video frame buffer;
-	how to embed timecode into an AJA deviceʼs SDI output signal;
-	how to generate a buffer of audio, and embed it into an AJA deviceʼs output signal;
-	how to properly acquire and release an AJA device in order to use it exclusively;
-	how to use AutoCirculate to efficiently stream video and audio (using the old or new APIs based on a macro definition);
-	how to use an AJACircularBuffer and the producer/consumer model with AutoCirculate.

<b>Command line usage:</b>
@code
	ntv2player  [options...]
	
	-d|--device {spec}              Specifies the device to use by index number, serial number or generic model name.
	                                Defaults to first device (index 0).
	                                If model name specified, uses lowest-numbered matching device.

	-c|--channel {channelSpec}      Specifies the framestore/channel as an unsigned integer number 1 thru 8.

	-v|--videoFormat {vidFormat}    Specifies the video format to use. Use '?' or 'list' to list available formats.

	-p|--pixelFormat {pixFormat}    Specifies the pixel format to use. Use '?' or 'list' to list available formats.

	-a|--anc {filePath}             Optionally emits ancillary data as read from the specified binary data file.
	                                These files can be recorded using the \ref ntv2capture using its ‘--ancʼ option.

	-t|--hdrType {hdrSpec}          Emits HDR ancillary data packets. Use 'SDR', 'HDR10' or 'HLG'.

	-m|--multiChannel               Enables multichannel/multiformat mode, and shares the device with other processes.

	--noaudio                       Omits audio.

	-?|--help|--usage               Shows how to use this command.
