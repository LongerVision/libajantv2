	This page describes the <b>Corvid 24</b> OEM capture/playout board, which features bypass relays on each SDI
	connector that can operate under software control or hardware control (using the built-in “watchdog” timer).
	Its four SDI connectors can programmatically be configured as inputs or outputs.
	It’s identified by ::DEVICE_ID_CORVID24.

	@note	This board has been superseded by \ref kona4quad.
			See the <a href="https://sdksupport.aja.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/eolnotice-corvid24">EOL Announcement</a> for details.

	The Corvid24 has four bi-directional SDI connectors, plus a reference input.
	The connector on the far left is for the optional AJA \ref aja102953 .

	@par	PCI Interface

	-	PCI device ID: <b>0xDB09</b>
	-	Four-lane gen 2 PCI Express
	-	2 DMA engines
	-	Legacy interrupt delivery (INTA\# for all interrupts) — MSI not supported

	@par	Inputs & Outputs

	-	4 × SDI bi-directional inputs/outputs (under software control)
	-	1 × reference input
	-	2 × RS-422 serial ports

	@par	Frame Buffer

	-	512 MB SDRAM
	-	64 × 8MB frames
	-	32 × 16MB frames for 2K (1080×2048), 1920×1080 VANC, and 16-bit RGB

	@par	Audio

	-	4 audio systems
	-	16 channels (max.) per audio system
	-	First audio system’s 8MB buffer memory ends at the end of SDRAM

	@par	Video Formats

	-	Supports most standard video formats.
	-	Does not support DVCPro HD or HDV.
	-	RGB on SDI inputs/outputs not supported.

	@note	A hardware color-space converter (CSC) can convert the input/output YCbCr SDI to/from RGB when using RGB buffer formats.

	-	\ref vancframegeometries only

	@par		External Connectivity

	-	Optional breakout cable (AJA \ref aja102953) provides access to other inputs and outputs

	@par		Bypass Relays

	In a typical facility a video signal may pass through many types of equipment before reaching its final destination.
	In the event that a device in this video path should fail, the disruption of the signal can be minimized by bypassing
	the faulty device.

	The AJA Corvid24 board has relays on its SDI connectors that can perform this bypass function.  One set of relays will
	bypass the SDI 1 and SDI 2 connectors, and the other set of relays will bypass connectors SDI 3 and SDI 4. The two sets
	of relays are independently controllable.

	The relays may be switched directly by software, or they can be put under the control of a watchdog timer. The watchdog
	can be configured to switch the relays to bypass after a programmable time interval has elapsed. Software can prevent
	this by writing specific values to the watchdog before the time interval expires to indicate it is still functioning properly.

	Users of the bypass relay feature will want to cable their systems with SDI 1 and SDI 3 as inputs, and SDI 2 and SDI 4
	as outputs. Note that by default the Corvid24 firmware will configure SDI 1 and SDI 2 as inputs, and SDI 3 and SDI 4 as
	outputs. Because of this, during initialization user applications should use the CNTV2Card::SetSDITransmitEnable SDK call
	to set the correct direction of the SDI ports before taking the relays out of bypass.

	@par		Hardware Jumpers

	Two jumpers on the upper left of the component side of the Corvid24 enable or disable control of the bypass relays.
	The top jumper controls the bypass between SDI connectors 1 and 2, and the other between connectors 3 and 4.
	When a jumper is in the leftmost position, the corresponding bypass relays are disabled, and the SDI signals are
	connected to the logic on the board. This is the same routing as AJA boards without relays. When a jumper is in the
	rightmost position, control of the relay state is put under firmware control. In Figure 5 below, the connector 1 and 2
	bypass (Jumper 1) is controlled by the firmware, and the connector 3 and 4 bypass (Jumper 2) is disabled.

	The NTV2 SDK provides several functions for querying and/or controlling the bypass relays:
	-	CNTV2Card::GetSDIRelayManualControl and CNTV2Card::SetSDIRelayManualControl
	-	CNTV2Card::GetSDIWatchdogEnable and CNTV2Card::SetSDIWatchdogEnable
	-	CNTV2Card::GetSDIWatchdogTimeout and CNTV2Card::SetSDIWatchdogTimeout
	-	CNTV2Card::GetSDIWatchdogStatus
	-	CNTV2Card::GetSDIRelayPosition
