@subsection	inspectorgeneralop		General Operation

The <b>NTV2 Watcher</b> is a graphical tool that interactively monitors and configures an NTV2 device.

@image	html	watcherlayout.png

The user interface consists of a main window that contains these major elements:
-	<b>Common Device Controls</b> — These Toolbars are common to all devices (and can be undocked, if desired):
	-	<b>Device Selection</b> Toolbar — for selecting which device to monitor/control;
	-	<b>Common Controls</b> Toolbar — for changing the poll rate, task mode, and other “global” aspects of the device.
-	<b>Inspector List</b> — for selecting which aspect of the device to inspect and/or control;
-	<b>Inspector Display Area</b> — the main data display area;
-	<b>Status Bar</b> — which holds the status indicators:
	-	<b>Status Message</b> — for messages;
	-	<b>Selection Indicator</b> — Some inspectors allow data portions to be selected interactively using the keyboard or mouse.
		This part of the Status Bar indicates the current selection.
	-	<b>Endianness</b> — Some inspectors display 2/4/8-byte values.
		This indicator shows the current endianness of the data display as <b>BE</b> (“Big Endian”) or <b>LE</b> (“Little Endian”).
		It’s colored Green if it’s the native endianness, or Yellow if not native.
	-	<b>Die Temperature</b> — Indicates the die temperature of the FPGA.
	-	<b>Refresh Rate</b> — This part of the Status Bar shows the measured refresh rate of the inspector display (a moving average).


@par	Device Selection

@image	html	watcher-deviceselection.png

A single instance of <b>NTV2 Watcher</b> monitors and/or controls one AJA device at a time.
This panel provides the ability to choose which AJA device the tool will focus on.

Choosing an item in the menu causes <b>NTV2 Watcher</b> to stop monitoring the previously-selected AJA device,
and starts it monitoring the newly-selected AJA device. Depending on the device and its capabilities,
the list of available inspectors may change.

To monitor an NTV2 device that’s running on another machine in your local network, click the <b>+</b> button
and enter the machine’s IP address in the dialog that appears … then click OK.
The first device local to that machine will be added to the popup menu.

To remove a remote device, be sure it’s the currently selected one, then click the <b>-</b> button.

@note	The “NTV2 Nub” server must be running on any machine to permit its devices to be monitored remotely.


@par	Menu Commands

Here’s what’s in the menu bar:
-	<b>File</b> Menu
	-	<b>Save As…</b> — Saves (exports) “raw” data for the \ref inspectorframebuffer and \ref inspectoraudio.
	-	<b>Print…</b> — Prints the diagram and code panels for the \ref inspectorroute.

		to diagnose issues and ascertain the state of the AJA device.
	-	<b>Capture SDRAM Contents</b> — Records the contents of device SDRAM into a “.raw” binary data file.
		This may be requested on rare occasion by AJA SDK Support staff in order to diagnose certain issues.
	-	<b>SDK Documentation</b> — Opens your web browser to the main page of the online SDK Documentation.
	-	<b>NTV2Watcher User Guide</b> — Opens your web browser to the online \ref usingntv2watcher User Guide.


@par	Common Settings

@image	html	watcher-commonsettings.png

There are several settings that are common to the device and apply to all inspectors:
-	<b>Poll Device</b> — Check the box to repeatedly poll the device, and update the Watcher’s data displays.
	Un-check the box to “freeze” the Watcher’s data displays.
	Some inspectors are sync’d to an input/output/reference VBI and ignore this setting.
-	<b>Polling Interval</b> — Adjusts the polling interval, from 25 milliseconds up to 2 seconds.
	Some inspectors are sync’d to an input/output/reference VBI and ignore this setting.
-	<b>Task Mode</b> — Indicates the device’s current task mode, and allows it to be changed by choosing a different setting.
-	<b>Multi-Format Mode</b> — Indicates the device’s “multi-format” mode, and allows it to be changed by choosing a different setting.
-	<b>Reference</b> — Indicates the device’s current clock reference setting, and allows it to be changed by choosing a different setting.


@par	Inspectors

@image	html	watcher-inspectorlist.png

There are a number of inspectors shown in the list at the left side of the window, only one of which can be selected at any given time.
This list may change if more capabilities are added to <b>NTV2 Watcher</b> in subsequent SDK releases.

Each inspector has its own particular user interface that’s designed to monitor and/or control a specific aspect of the AJA device.

Clicking on an inspector item in the list replaces the one that was previously selected with the one that was newly selected.
If you click back to return to an inspector that was previously in use, its state is exactly as it was left.
(Only when the device is changed does a new inspector get started in its default state.)

Right-clicking an inspector item in the list pops up a menu with one choice: “Move to Separate Window”.
Choosing <b>Move to Separate Window</b> — or double-clicking an inspector item in the list — opens the inspector in a separate window.
This permits multiple inspectors to be open simultaneously.

@note	Having multiple inspectors open in separate windows increases CPU utilization,
		and can significantly impact the DMA transfer budget of the device and the PCIe bus.

@bug	NTV2Watcher keeps some persistent settings data in a local config file.
		If this file gets corrupted, it can cause NTV2Watcher to hang or crash upon startup.
		To work around this issue:
		-	<b>Linux</b> — Delete the ‘NTV2Watcher.conf’ file from your local app data folder ‘~/.config/aja’.
		-	<b>Mac OS</b> — Delete the ‘NTV2Watcher’ folder from your local app data (in ‘/Users/<i>username</i>/Library/Application Support/AJA’).
		-	<b>Windows</b> — Delete the ‘NTV2Watcher’ folder from your local app data (in ‘/Users/<i>username</i>/AppData/Local/aja’).



<hr size="50px">
@subsection	inspectorframebuffer	Frame Buffer Inspector

@image	html	watcher-inspector-framebuffer.png

The <b>Frame Buffer</b> inspector monitors the contents of frame buffer memory on the AJA device.

@note	Because this inspector reads (via DMA) the entire contents of a frame buffer at the selected channel’s frame rate,
		it can interfere with any currently running video application, particularly if the additional DMAs exceed the available
		device or host data transfer budget. Thus, this inspector is not immune from “Heisenbugs” in which the act of monitoring
		an AJA device affects it and the application(s) under test.

Frame buffer memory contents can be displayed in four different <b>View Mode</b>s:
	-	<b>Line</b> — The full raster (including VANC lines, if any), line-by-line, in hexadecimal format, grouped by byte, 2-byte word, 4-byte longword or 8-byte (64-bit) chunks.
	-	<b>Raw</b> — The entire 8MB or 16MB buffer in fixed-length “lines”, grouped by 1, 2, 4 or 8 byte chunks. The line length is adjustable.
		By default, unless disabled, boundaries between raster lines are indicated with a blue marker.
		Regions and planes are indicated by color:  green for audio, yellow for Ancillary data, etc.
	-	<b>Component</b> — The full raster (including VANC lines, if any), line-by-line, in component format,
		dictated by the frame store’s frame buffer format, in hex or decimal.
		@image	html	watcher-inspector-fb-comp.png
	-	<b>Waveform</b> — The full raster (including VANC lines, if any), one-line-at-a-time, as a waveform,
		with the component waveforms overlaid on top of each other.
		@image	html	watcher-inspector-fb-wfm.png
	-	<b>Image</b> — The visible raster, as an image.

This inspector repeatedly monitors the indicated frame buffer for the selected channel or frame store.
	-	It reads (via DMA) the frame buffer into host memory.
		-	In <b>Raw</b> mode, or for planar pixel formats, it reads the entire 8MB/16MB/32MB/etc. buffer.
		-	All other views — <b>Line</b>, <b>Component</b>, <b>Waveform</b>, <b>Image</b>  — it reads the frame buffer up to
			and including the last visible raster line.
	-	The inspector attempts to refresh at the FrameStore’s current frame rate (as soon after the VBI as possible).
		-	An indicator in the bottom-right corner of the main window’s status bar shows the average time between updates.
		-	When the indicator exceeds the reciprocal of the frame rate, then the inspector is not frame-accurate.
	-	After each refresh, it compares the frame buffer contents to what was read the last time:
		-	The bottom left of the main window‘s status bar shows the number of raster lines that changed from the last frame
			(except <b>Raw</b> view).
		-	The data display highlights changed content with a brighter color (except <b>Image</b> view).
		-	<b>Frame Differencing mode</b> statically highlights the differences between the current frame and another frame.


@par	Frame/Buffer Controls
	-	<b>FrameStore/Channel</b> — Selects the FrameStore/Channel of interest.
	-	<b>On/Off</b> — Indicates if the FrameStore/Channel is enabled or not.  It can be changed using this menu
		(if not in <b>Auto</b> mode and the device <b>Task Mode</b> is not <b>Standard Tasks</b>).
		-	See also:  CNTV2Card::EnableChannel , CNTV2Card::DisableChannel , CNTV2Card::IsChannelEnabled , \ref vidop-fs
	-	<b>Frame Size</b> Indicator — This shows the discrete size of the frame … i.e. the location of the frame boundaries
		in device memory. This will be the “intrinsic” minimum size of 8MB or 16MB, whatever is the largest size required by all device FrameStores
		(determined by the hardware firmware), and multiplied by 4 or 8 for UHD/4K or UHD2/8K rasters, respectively.
	-	<b>Auto</b> — If checked, the frame number being monitored will automatically follow the input or output
		(depending on frame-store mode) “current frame” register, and the frame number spin control will be disabled.
		If this is unchecked, the frame number spin control will be available, and the frame being watched can be manually controlled.
		When unchecked, many other aspects of the device can be controlled (e.g., <b>Mode</b>, <b>Geometry</b>, <b>Format</b>, <b>Size</b>, etc.),
		including the ability to manually edit/change the buffer content.
	-	<b>Frame Number</b> spin control:  When available, controls which frame to view.
		When unavailable, indicates the frame being viewed. Frame 0 is the first frame in device memory.
		-	Note that this <b>Frame Number</b> in combination with the indicated <b>Frame Size</b> (above) determines the region in device memory
			being displayed. The offset and length calculation of this region is done in the context of the currently selected <b>FrameStore/Channel</b>.
		-	For example, if FrameStores 1 and 3 on a \ref kona5 are configured for UHD/2vuy, and FrameStore 2 is configured for 720p/2vuy…
			-	Each frame of FrameStores 1 and 3 is 32MB in length.
			-	Each frame of FrameStore 2 is 8MB in length.
			-	Therefore, frames 0, 1, 2 and 3 of FrameStore 2 would all lie inside frame 0 of FrameStores 1 and 3.
			-	Similarly, frames 4, 5, 6 and 7 of FrameStore 2 would all lie inside frame 1 of FrameStores 1 and 3.
			-	And so on…
		@note	Even though the current frame’s contents may have been written in the context of <i>another</i> <b>FrameStore/Channel</b> (e.g. '2vuy'),
				this inspector displays the frame’s data in the context of its <i>current</i> <b>FrameStore/Channel</b> (e.g. 'v210'), and thus may
				appear completely wrong, especially as an Image <b>View Mode</b>.

		-	Drag operations started from inside the Frame Buffer inspector view cannot end outside the view (not yet supported).
		-	Ctrl+Shift+Drag operations started from inside an existing selection in the Frame Buffer inspector
			(<b>Line</b> or <b>Raw</b> views only) will copy the underlying raster data to where it’s dropped in the frame buffer.
		-	Dropping files and/or folders from outside the NTV2Watcher window are supported.
			(Prior to SDK 15.3, only one file having a particular name extension could be dropped at one time.)
			-	The first frame buffer to be changed is determined by the <b>frame number</b> spinbox control.
				Subsequent files are loaded into successive frame buffers.
			-	The order of the files (and therefore which frame(s) get which file’s data) is host operating-system dependent.
			-	Dropped folders have their immediate contents enumerated.
			-	Symbolic links are skipped and not followed.
			-	Files are first attempted to be loaded as <b>Image Files</b> <i>regardless of name extension</i>.
				-	Most popular image formats are supported (e.g. <b>PNG</b>, <b>JPG</b>, <b>BMP</b>, etc.).
				-	If the image is decoded and loaded successfully, the frame’s visible raster content is replaced with the image.
				-	If the image dimensions differ from the frame geometry, the image is scaled to fit without altering its aspect ratio.
				-	Hold down the <b>Shift</b> key when dropping the file(s) to have the image’s aspect ratio changed to fill the raster.
					This will squish or stretch the image vertically or horizontally (or both).
			-	All other readable files are treated as <b>Raw Binary Data Files</b>:
				-	The frame’s buffer content is replaced byte-for-byte with the raw data from the file.
				-	If the raw file is smaller than the frame buffer, only the bytes from the file will overwrite the frame buffer.
					All subsequent content in the buffer will remain unchanged.
				-	If the raw file is larger than the frame buffer, subsequent frames will continue to be written until the
					remaining bytes from the file are read (or until the highest-numbered frame in device SDRAM has been DMA’d).

@subsection	inspectoraudio		Audio Inspector

@image	html	watcher-inspector-audio.png

The <b>Audio</b> inspector monitors the input or output of a selected audio engine of the AJA device, including its buffer memory
and read or write “head” position.

@note	Because this inspector reads (via DMA) the entire contents of an audio buffer at NTV2Watcher’s currently selected polling rate,
		it can interfere with any currently running application, particularly if the additional DMAs exceed the available
		device or host data transfer budget. Thus, this inspector is not immune from “Heisenbugs” in which the act of monitoring an AJA
		device affects it and the application(s) under test.

Audio buffer memory contents can be displayed in three ways:
	-	<b>Raw</b> — The entire buffer in per-channel “lines”, each sample value shown as a 4-byte (32-bit) longword.
	-	<b>Waveform</b> — A stack of waveform plots, for each audio channel that’s carrying PCM data.
	-	<b>Phase</b> — A phase plot of one audio channel against another. Both audio channels must be carrying PCM data.

When device polling is enabled, this inspector repeatedly monitors the audio system’s input or output buffer.
It reads the entire buffer into host memory and compares it to its previous contents.
The status bar shows the read or write head position, as well as what changed.
The display highlights changed content with a brighter color.

		-	<b>Write-Enable</b> — (Shown only in <b>Input</b> mode.) If checked, and if the capture audio system is running, captured audio will be written into
			the audio system’s capture buffer at the <b>Write Head</b>. Otherwise, the audio system will not be permitted to write into the capture buffer.
		-	<b>Erase</b> — (Shown only in <b>Output</b> mode.) If checked, the audio system will automatically write silence (i.e., zero values) into the output buffer
			immediately behind the <b>Read Head</b>.
		-	<b>Embed</b> — (Shown only in <b>Output</b> mode.) If checked, the audio system’s output audio embedder is enabled.
			If unchecked, the audio system’s output embedder is disabled, and will emit no audio packets.
		-	<b>PCM Output</b> — (Shown only in <b>Output</b> mode, and only for devices that lack per-audio-channel-pair PCM control.)
			If checked, the output embedder marks all outgoing audio packets as normal PCM.
			If unchecked, the output embedder marks all outgoing audio packets as non-PCM.
		-	<b>Non-PCM Output</b> — (Shown only in <b>Output</b> mode, and only for devices that have per-audio-channel-pair PCM control.)
			This popup menu lists all possible channel pairs.
			If a channel pair is checked, the output embedder marks outgoing audio packets for that channel pair as non-PCM.
			If a channel pair is unchecked, the output embedder marks outgoing audio packets for that channel pair as normal PCM.
	-	<b>Mode and View Controls</b>
		-	<b>View</b> — Controls which part of the audio system to inspect:
			-	<b>Input</b> — Inspects the input (capture) audio buffer. Look for changes up to the write head, where the de-embedder is writing new samples.
			-	<b>Output</b> — Inspects the output (playout) audio buffer. Look for changes ahead of the read head, where a playout application may be writing new samples.
		-	<b>Auto</b> — If checked, automatically and dynamically scrolls the display to reveal the audio data that immediately precedes the <b>Read Head</b> or follows the <b>Write Head</b>.
		-	<b>Mon</b> — If checked, sends new audio data to the host audio system. (<b>Note:</b> Because of the nature of digital audio, and the human ear’s sensitivity to
			interruptions or distortions in audio waveforms, monitoring audio should only be done with very short polling intervals.)
		-	<b>AutoDetect</b> — If checked, scans for muted channels or channels that contain Dolby-encoded audio data, and augments the <b>Vertical Ruler</b> scale accordingly.

@subsection	inspectoranc		Ancillary Data Inspector

@image	html	watcher-inspector-anc.png

The <b>Anc</b> inspector monitors the ancillary data areas of a frame buffer, and the state registers of the device’s Anc inserter/extractor widgets (if any).

@note	Because this inspector reads (via DMA) the entire contents of a frame buffer at NTV2Watcher’s currently selected polling rate,
		it can interfere with any currently running application, particularly if the additional DMAs exceed the available
		device or host data transfer budget. Thus, this inspector is not immune from “Heisenbugs” (the Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle)
		in which the act of monitoring an AJA device affects it and the application(s) under test.

The Anc inspector has four main sections:
	-	<b>Channel/FrameStore and Frame Selection</b> — Selects a FrameStore (Channel) and frame to inspect.
		-	<b>FrameStore/Channel</b> — Selects the FrameStore/Channel of interest. On devices that have Anc Inserters/Extractors:
			-	In <b>Capture Mode</b>, this indicates the SDI Input associated with the firmware Anc Extractor being inspected/controlled.
			-	In <b>Playout Mode</b>, this indicates the SDI Output associated with the firmware Anc Inserter being inspected/controlled.
		-	<b>Auto</b> — If checked, the frame number being monitored will automatically follow the input or output
			(depending on frame-store mode) “current frame” register, and the frame number spin control will be disabled.
			If this is unchecked, the frame number spin control will be available, and the frame being watched can be manually controlled.
		-	<b>Frame Number</b> spin control:  When available, controls which frame to view.
			When unavailable, indicates the frame being viewed.
		-	<b>Video Format Indicator</b> — Indicates the Channel/FrameStore’s current video standard, frame rate and geometry.
	-	<b>Line 21</b> — This section is visible only when the Channel/FrameStore is configured for 525i SD,
		and shows the byte pairs decoded from line 21 (if any).
	-	<b>Line 284</b> — This section is visible only when the Channel/FrameStore is configured for 525i SD,
		and shows the byte pairs decoded from line 284 (if any).
	-	<b>VANC</b> — The VANC section shows the Channel/FrameStore’s current VANC configuration (“Off”, “Tall” or “Taller”) and VANC buffer data.
		-	<b>Mode</b> — This menu/combobox is provided to indicate the current <b>VANC Mode</b>, and change it, if desired.
	-	<b>Anc Registers</b> — This area is visible only for devices that have Anc inserters/extractors. When visible,
		it shows the content of the inserter/extractor configuration registers. The register values are editable.
		-	<b>Anc Exclusions:</b> — This menu/combobox is provided to indicate which Anc packet types (Data IDs)
			are currently being excluded by the Anc Extractor. It can be used to add or remove Anc packet types from the exclusion set.
			-	<b>None (Show All Packets)</b> — Checked if the Anc Extractor is not filtering any packets.
				Choose this item to stop all packet filtering (i.e. to extract all packet types).
			-	<b>SD Defaults</b> — Checked if the Anc Extractor is not filtering SD audio packets.
				Choose this item to filter all SD audio packets.
			-	<b>HD Defaults</b> — Checked if the Anc Extractor is not filtering HD audio packets.
				Choose this item to filter all HD audio packets.
			-	<i>all other items</i> — The menu has dozens of pre-defined Anc packet types available for filtering.
				For each Anc packet type (i.e. Data ID, or DID)…
				-	If checked, the Anc Extractor is currently filtering that packet type (Data ID).
					Selecting the item will toggle its state and remove the DID from the Extractor’s filter set.
				-	If unchecked, the Anc Extractor is <i>not</i> currently filtering that packet type (Data ID).
					Selecting the item will toggle its state and add the DID to the Extractor’s filter set.
	-	<b>F1 Anc</b> — This area is visible only for devices that have Anc inserters/extractors. When visible, it displays the contents
		of the 0x12000-byte region that starts -0x24000 bytes from the end of the frame buffer. This buffer is where the extractor
		places packet data extracted from Field 1 of interlaced video or from progressive video. It’s also where the inserter fetches packets for
		output (for progressive video or interlaced Field 1).
	-	<b>F2 Anc</b> — This area is visible only for devices that have Anc inserters/extractors, and only when the channel is running interlaced video.
		When visible, it displays the contents of the 0x12000-byte region that starts -0x12000 bytes from the end of the frame buffer.
		This is where the extractor places packets captured from Field 2. It’s also where the inserter fetches packets for output into interlaced Field 2.

A menu/combobox is provided for each of the <b>VANC</b>, <b>F1 Anc</b> and <b>F2 Anc</b> display areas, to control how each area’s Anc data is displayed:
	-	<b>Hide</b> — Hides the buffer display. This has secondary benefits:
		-	It makes room for other buffer displays you may be interested in.
		-	It uses less CPU, allowing it to update other inspectors faster (e.g. CEA-608 Caption Viewer).
	-	<b>Raw</b> — Displays the buffer as raw data. By right-clicking in the content area, you can change the data display’s grouping
		(1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes) and radix (binary, octal, decimal or hex). The bytes-per-row count of the VANC display is fixed by the channel’s frame
		geometry, but the F1 and F2 Anc buffer displays can be changed from 8, 16, 32, … up to 4096 bytes per line. You can also change the
		scale reference and/or radix by right-clicking in the column and/or row headings.
	-	<b>Packets</b> — Displays a list of Anc data packets parsed from the byte stream found in the buffer. For each packet found, it shows:
		-	<b>Cod</b> — Coding – <b>Ana</b>log or <b>Dig</b>ital.
		-	<b>Fmt</b> — Originating Buffer Format: <b>SDI</b>, <b>RTP</b> or <b>VANC</b>.
		-	<b>Timestamp</b> — Capture from RTP source: the timestamp from the RTP header.
		-	<b>Lnk</b> — The data link (A or B).
		-	<b>DS</b> — The data stream (DS1 … DS4).
		-	<b>Line</b> — On capture, the SMPTE line number where the data was found;  on playout, the SMPTE line number where the data is to be inserted.
		-	<b>HOff</b> — Horizontal Offset: or HANC or VANC.
		-	<b>Chn</b> — Channel: Luma (Y) or chroma (C).
		-	<b>DID</b> — The DID of the packet.
		-	<b>SDID</b> — The SDID of the packet.
		-	<b>Description</b> — Packet description.
		-	<b>DC</b> — Data Count of the payload data, in bytes.
		-	<b>CS</b> — The checksum of the payload data. Note that on playout, this value is irrelevant, since the inserter/embedder performs the checksum computation.
		-	<b>Data</b> — The payload data bytes.

When device polling is enabled, this inspector repeatedly monitors the device frame buffer at every VBI of the selected Channel/FrameStore,
ignoring the <b>Interval</b> slider setting.
It reads the portions of the buffer that contain anc data into host memory and compares it to what was read the last time.
Changed values are drawn with a brighter color.
Old packets that were detected earlier but are now currently absent are shown in a very dim color.
To clear the old packets from the display, right-click in the packet list and choose “Clear Old Packets” from the menu that appears.

Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu to copy a human-readable snapshot of the displayed information to the Clipboard.

This inspector can be used to drive the \ref anc608viewer for monitoring closed-captions. To prevent duplicate or multiple caption byte streams
from being sent to the \ref anc608viewer , it’s best to have only one of the Anc buffer regions visible and set to display “Packets”, and also,
if only one caption packet is in the monitored buffer.

<b>Drag and Drop</b> support:
	-	Dropping a single file from outside the inspector window is supported only if <b>Auto</b> mode is disabled.
	-	Dropping the file into the <b>F1 Anc</b> or <b>F2 Anc</b> data areas (if visible, in either <b>Raw</b>
		or <b>Packets</b> view) will write the binary contents of the file into the Anc region of the frame buffer.
	-	Dropping the file into the <b>VANC Anc</b> data area (if visible, in either <b>Raw</b> or <b>Packets</b>
		view) will write the binary contents of the file into the VANC lines (if VANC mode enabled) of the frame buffer.

@note Data coloring in the <b>Ancillary Data Inspector</b> can be configured in the <b>Colors</b> tab of the \ref watcherprefs dialog.

@subsection	inspectorac		AutoCirculate Inspector

@image	html	watcher-inspector-ac.png

The <b>AutoCirculate</b> inspector monitors the \ref aboutautocirculate state for every available channel on the device.

The inspector shows the following:
	-	<b>Streaming Application</b> — Shows the process ID and four-CC “signature” of the application that called CNTV2Card::SetStreamingApplication.
	-	<b>AutoCirculate Status</b> — Formats and displays ::AUTOCIRCULATE_STATUS information pulled from the CNTV2Card::AutoCirculateGetStatus function
		call for each ::NTV2Channel.
	-	<b>Timecodes</b> — This area shows the contents of the ::NTV2TimeCodeList returned from CNTV2Card::AutoCirculateGetFrameStamp
		for each AutoCirculate frame buffer. Use the <b>Timecodes</b> popup menu to control which channel to display (or “Hide” to not display timecodes).
		-	<b>NOTE:</b> This area doesn’t appear on S2110 devices (i.e. \ref konaip \ref ioip running S2110 firmware).
			This is because the driver’s internal AutoCirculate structures are tied to the hardware timecode registers,
			which are uninvolved in S2110. In S2110, timecodes are obtained (capture) or produced (playout) in ATC-LTC
			or ATC-VITC packets embedded in RTP packet(s).

@subsection	inspectorlut		LUT Inspector

@image	html	watcher-inspector-lut.png

The <b>LUT</b> inspector monitors and controls any one of the device’s LUT banks (see \ref vidop-lut ).
Because of access contention issues, it does not continually poll and update its LUT display.
Instead, the displayed table data must be manually loaded from the device on demand.

-	The data display is a 1,024-row table with three columns, one column per color component.
	It represents the contents of an in-host data buffer.
-	To load the in-host data buffer from the device, set the <b>LUT</b> of interest using the menu control,
	then right-click inside the table, and choose one of the <b>Load from Bank</b> commands.
	The contents of the in-host buffer are replaced.

		-	Dropping a CSV or tab-delimited data file into the table will replace some/all the in-host data buffer cell values
			with the contents of the file.
			-	Excess columns and/or rows are ignored in files containing more than 3 columns or more than 1024 rows.
			-	If the drop location is inside the table, the in-host buffer will be overwritten starting at the highlighted cell;
				otherwise, it will be overwritten starting at the top/left data cell.
	-	Changes made to the table are not saved unless explicitly exported (or copy/pasted) into a file, or written to the device.
		No warnings are given before replacing/overwriting the in-host table buffer being edited. There is no <b>Undo</b> facility.

@subsection	inspectorregs		Registers Inspector

@image	html	watcher-inspector-regs.png

The <b>Regs</b> inspector monitors any number of real and/or virtual 32-bit registers at NTV2Watcher’s current Polling Interval.
Its <b>Filter</b> feature permits immediate customization to focus on specific registers of interest.

The inspector has the following:
	-	A scrollable table of registers, one register per row, in ascending register number (i.e. bar address) order.
	-	<b>Virtuals</b> — A checkbox that controls if virtual registers are included in the list or not.
	-	<b>Filter</b> — An editable text box whose content determines which registers are seen in the list.
		It’s accompanied by a pop-up menu containing several named register groups, and any saved filters.
		The text in the box acts as a filter:
		-	<i>empty</i> — No filtering takes place. All registers are shown.
		-	<i>decimal numbers</i> — A comma-separated list of register number ranges. For example:
			-	<b>25</b> — Only show register 25
			-	<b>25-31</b> — Only show registers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31.
			-	<b>3,5,7</b> — Only show registers 3, 5 and 7.
			-	<b>3-7,20</b> — Only show registers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 20.
		-	<b>kRegClass</b>… — A predefined group of registers.
			The popup menu shows these predefined register groups (e.g., inputs, outputs, HDMI, etc.).
		-	Anything else is used in a case-insensitive search for register names containing the text.
	-	<b>Save</b> — Available if the filter text isn’t currently a preset in the popup menu.
		Click to save the filter as a new preset.
	-	<b>Remove</b> — Available if the filter text matches a previously-saved preset in the popup menu.
		Click to remove it from the popup menu.

The register list is a table of register values in register number order.
Right-clicking in any of the column headings pops up a menu:
	-	<b>Column Display</b> — Controls which columns are shown, and their order:
		-	<b>Reg Number</b> — The register number
		-	<b>Reg Offset</b> — The register offset into its base address range (BAR).
		-	<b>Reg Name</b> — The register name.
		-	<b>Reg Value</b> — The register value.
		-	<b>Reg Decoded Value</b> — Text that shows the register value in a human-readable format.
	-	<b>Radix</b> — Controls the radix of the displayed register values.
		-	<b>Bin (Base 2)</b> — Display register values in base 2 (binary).
		-	<b>Oct (Base 8)</b> — Display register values in base 8 (octal).
		-	<b>Dec (Base 10)</b> — Display register values in base 10 (unsigned decimal).
		-	<b>Hex (Base 16)</b> — Display register values in base 16 (hexadecimal).

To change a register’s value:
	-	Click inside the register value. An edit box will appear.
	-	Change the value in the edit box as desired (keeping to the existing display radix).
	-	Press <b>Enter</b> or <b>Return</b> to confirm your changes, and write the new register value to the device.
		The edit box will disappear.
	-	Press <b>Escape</b> or click elsewhere to abandon your changes.
		The edit box will disappear.

Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu to copy to the host’s Clipboard a set of CNTV2Card::WriteRegister
function calls that will produce the register values seen in the display.

<b>TIP:</b>  The \ref regautocycler can be used to periodically cycle a register between a minimum and maximum value.

@subsection	inspectorroute		Routing Inspector

@image	html	watcher-inspector-routing.png

The <b>Routing</b> inspector monitors and controls widget signal crosspoint routing as well as widget state (to some degree).

@note	This inspector replaces the original \ref usingcables utility with this significant difference:
		-	RGB and YCbCr output crosspoints are shown in separate sockets.
			In the old \ref usingcables they were shown as one socket, which caused some confusion.

The inspector has the following individual panels:
	-	<b>Routing Diagram</b> — Shows the device widgets and signal connections between them.
	-	<b>Code</b> — A text-only representation of the device’s current routing connections.
		It can display the routing in three different ways:
		-	<b>C++ Code</b> — C++ code that will produce the current routing configuration
			using CNTV2Card::Connect calls. This is the default.
		-	<b>Shorthand</b> — Widget connections are shown mnemonically.
	-	<b>Routing Registers</b> — A panel containing a list of the device’s routing registers.
		The register values are editable, and can be changed.

Choose <b>Print…</b> from the <b>File</b> menu to print a two-page report of the current routing configuration.

Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu to copy a human-readable snapshot of the displayed routing information to the Clipboard.

This inspector will accept plain text either pasted in (using the <b>Paste</b> command from the <b>Edit</b> menu),
or by dropping it in (using drag-and-drop) from another application. To be interpreted correctly as a set of routing
connections, the text must syntactically conform to:
	-	<b>C++ Statements</b> — One or more lines, each containing a call to CNTV2Card::Connect :
		@code{.cpp}
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptFrameBuffer1Input, NTV2_XptSDIIn1);
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptCSC1VidInput, NTV2_XptSDIIn1);
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptCSC2VidInput, NTV2_XptSDIIn1DS2);
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptLUT1Input, NTV2_XptCSC1VidRGB);
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptLUT2Input, NTV2_XptCSC2VidRGB);
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptSDIOut3Input, NTV2_XptSDIIn1);
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptSDIOut4Input, NTV2_XptSDIIn1DS2);
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptHDMIOutInput, NTV2_XptSDIIn1);
			device.Connect (NTV2_XptAnalogOutInput, NTV2_XptSDIIn1);
		@endcode
	-	<b>Shorthand Notation</b> — One or more lines having the “shorthand” notation:
		@code
			FB1 <== SDIIn1
			CSC1 <== SDIIn1
			CSC2 <== SDIIn1DS2
			LUT1 <== CSC1RGB
			LUT2 <== CSC2RGB
			SDIOut3 <== SDIIn1
			SDIOut4 <== SDIIn1DS2
			HDMIOutQ1 <== SDIIn1
			AnalogOut <== SDIIn1
		@endcode

<b>Routing Diagram</b>

The <b>Routing Diagram</b> is where routing changes are performed interactively. This is the panel in which most tasks are performed.

There are these principal types of objects in the diagram:
-	<b>Widgets</b> — These represent the functional widgets implemented in the device firmware, such as FrameStores, SDI Inputs, etc.
	-	<b>Widget</b>s contain one or more <b>Sockets</b> that represent each of the <b>Widget</b>’s crosspoint connections.
	-	<b>Sockets</b> are little square boxes inside a <b>Widget</b>.
		They cannot move independently — they always move with their owning <b>Widget</b>.
		There are two kinds of <b>Sockets</b>:
		-	<b>Input</b> — This is a signal “sink” or “destination” crosspoint.
			-	<b>Input</b>s are always on the widget’s left side.
			-	<b>Input</b>s can only be connected to one <b>Output</b> crosspoint.
			-	Depending on the parent <b>Widget</b>, <b>Input Socket</b>s sometimes can accept both RGB or YCbCr signals, or only RGB or YCbCr.
		-	<b>Output</b> — This is a signal “source” crosspoint.
			-	<b>Output</b>s are always on the widget’s right side.
			-	<b>Output</b>s can be connected to any number of <b>Input</b> crosspoints.
			-	<b>Output</b>s have a fixed signal type that they emit (if enabled): YCbCr or RGB.
	-	<b>Socket</b>s can be logically <b>enabled</b> or <b>disabled</b>, usually determined by
		the parent <b>Widget</b>’s configuration.
-	<b>Cables/Wires</b> — These represent the currently existing widget crosspoint connections,
	as read from the device’s “crosspoint select” registers.

Standard behaviors:
-	<b>Hovering</b>

		-	<b>Hide Unconnected</b> — Hides all widgets that aren’t connected to anything else.
		-	<b>Reset Positions</b> — Reset the layout of all widgets back to their default positions.
-	<b>Drag & Drop</b>
	-	For IDEs, text editors and word processors that support dragging/dropping text, the <b>Routing Diagram</b> panel will accept
		text data containing C++ code that contains CNTV2Card::Connect calls. If the dropped code parses correctly, whatever is
		stipulated by the code will replace the current routing. (NOTE: The parser is dirt-simple — it only works if the <b>Connect</b>
		function’s parameters are ::NTV2InputCrosspointID and ::NTV2OutputCrosspointID enums.)

<b>Code Panel</b>

The Code Panel shows the device’s current routing configuration in textual form.
	-	It does this in one of two ways:
		-	<b>C++ Code</b> — shows the SDK calls necessary to produce the routing configuration.
		-	<b>Shorthand</b> — shows the “shorthand” notation for it.
	-	The text panel is read-only — i.e., you can’t change what’s in it.
	-	It supports dragging text from it for dropping elsewhere (e.g. into a code editor window).
	-	Left-clicking allows text in the panel to be highlighted (selected) interactively with the mouse.
	-	Right-clicking pops up a context menu with these commands:
		-	<b>Copy</b> — Copies whatever text is highlighted in the panel to the host clipboard.
		-	<b>Select All</b> — Highlights all of the text in the panel.
	-	Other controls:
		-	<b>Code</b> Menu — Selects which encoding form to display.
		-	<b>Presets</b> Menu — Shows which preset matches the device’s current routing configuration (if any).
			Choosing one of the presets will replace the device’s current routing with the selected one.
		-	<b>+</b> Button — Click to define a new preset for the device’s current routing configuration.
		-	<b>-</b> Button — Click to delete the current routing preset.

<b>Routing Registers Panel</b>

The Registers Panel shows the device’s routing registers.
To edit a register’s value, click in its value, change the value, then press Enter (or click elsewhere).
If this causes a routing change, the diagram (and code panel) will reflect the change.


@note The <b>Routing Inspector</b> has several preference settings in the <b>Cables</b> tab of the \ref watcherprefs dialog.

@subsection	fillbufferdlog		“Fill Buffer” Tool

The <b>“Fill Buffer” Tool</b> is a handy debugging aid for filling device buffer memory with various values and/or patterns.

One or more frames can be written:
-	<b>Start Frame</b> — Specifies the first frame to be written.
-	<b>End Frame</b> — Determines the last frame to be written.
-	<b>All Frames</b> — Check this to quickly select all frames on the device to be written.

There are currently three ways to fill buffer memory:
	-#	<b>Numeric Value</b> — Fills one or more buffers with any 8, 16, 32 or 64-bit numeric value.
		@image	html	watcher-tool-fill-num.png
		Click <b>Apply</b> to write the numeric value into the frame buffer(s).
		Checkboxes are provided for skipping certain regions of each frame buffer being filled:
		-	<b>Field1</b> — Skips “Field 1” lines.
		-	<b>Field2</b> — Skips “Field 2” lines.
		-	<b>VANC</b> — Skips VANC lines. (Enabled only when the FrameStore geometry is “tall” or “taller”.)

@subsection	anc608viewer		“EIA/CEA-608 Caption” Tool

@image	html	watcher-tool-608caption.png

The <b>EIA/CEA-608 Caption Tool</b> is a handy debugging aid for viewing EIA-608 and/or CEA-608 caption byte-pair streams.
It works with the \ref inspectoranc to supply its CEA-608 decoder with a stream of caption byte pairs to supply sufficient
context in order to properly render captions. The tool window is dominated by two panels:
	-	<b>Byte-Pair Stream</b> — Displays a hexadecimal representation of the caption byte-pair stream being decoded.
		-	The text represents a byte-pair FIFO that holds up to 90 byte pairs (maximum):
			-	New byte pairs enter the FIFO at the bottom-right corner.
			-	The oldest byte pairs drop out of the FIFO at the top-left corner.
		-	When no caption data is being streamed, the text content can be edited:
			-	You can select all or part of the text, and copy it to the host’s clipboard.
			-	You can add, remove, or change its contents by typing, or by pasting text from the clipboard.
			-	The text must consist of 2-byte hexadecimal “words” separated by a single space (case is irrelevant).
				Any other format will fail to decode properly.
				-	The left-most 2 digits (most-significant byte) is “byte 1”;
				-	The right-most 2 digits (least-significant byte) is “byte 2”.
				-	Byte sequences from “.scc” sidecar files should work (but remove the timecodes).
			-	<b>Example:</b> Try the byte-pair sequence “<tt>9425 94ad 9170 c845 cc4c 4f20</tt>” —
				it should render “Hello” for CC1.
	-	<b>Decoded Captions</b> — Renders the decoded captions, as they appear on-screen.
		-	The 608 decoder always re-decodes the entire FIFO whenever it changes, processing the byte pairs top-left to bottom-right.
			-	The last pair in the FIFO enters the decoder first;
			-	The first pair in the FIFO enters the decoder last.

A <b>Channel</b> selector menu is provided to change the caption channel being decoded and displayed:
	-	CC1 — the normal, primary (English language) closed-caption channel sourced from Field 1.
	-	CC2 — the secondary (often Spanish language) closed-caption channel, also sourced from Field 1.
	-	CC3, CC4 — additional closed-caption channels, sourced from Field 2.
	-	TX1, TX2 — text-only channels sourced from Field 1.
	-	TX3, TX4 — text-only channels sourced from Field 2.
	-	XDS is currently not available for decoding or display.

A <b>Reset</b> button is provided to manually reset the decoder, if necessary.
Add or remove a space to/from it to force the decoder to re-render what’s in the byte stream.

To render captions in real-time, the decoder’s byte-pair FIFO requires a steady stream of caption
byte-pairs transmitted by the \ref inspectoranc :
	-	<b>“Analog” Captioning</b> — All of the following are true:
		-	The monitored FrameStore/Channel is receiving or transmitting SD (U.S. NTSC 525i) video;
		-	The monitored FrameStore/Channel has a 'v210' or '2vuy' pixel format;
		-	The current frame buffer contains a valid “analog” caption byte pair encoded
			as a waveform per EIA-608 in “line 21” of active video.
	-	<b>VANC Frame Geometry</b> — All of the following are true:
		-	“Tall” or “Taller” VANC mode is enabled;
		-	The monitored FrameStore/Channel has a 'v210' or '2vuy' pixel format;
			-	If 8-bit YCbCr, VANC Shift Mode must be enabled;
		-	The VANC anc display is set to “Packets”;
		-	The packet display must contain:
			-	a CEA-708 packet that contains “Service 0“ CEA-608 caption data, or…
			-	at least one CEA-608 packet.
	-	<b>Anc Extractor/Inserter F1 and/or F2</b> — All of the following are true:
		-	The monitored Anc Inserter/Extractor must be running;
		-	The Field 1 or Field 2 displays (or both) must be set to display “Packets”.
		-	One of the packet displays contains:
			-	a CEA-708 packet that contains “Service 0“ CEA-608 caption data, or…
			-	a CEA-608 packet.

	@note	Successful caption rendering relies on getting a continuous byte pair sequence (no dropped frames).
			If the refresh rate of the \ref inspectoranc lags the frame rate, byte pairs will be
			skipped, resulting in garbled and unreadable captions. Hiding one or more of the
			\ref inspectoranc viewers (VANC, Anc Registers, F1, F2) can save CPU cycles and prevent lagging
			refresh rates.

To freeze the <b>Byte-Pair Stream</b> (perhaps to permit interacting with it manually),
leave the <b>Caption Viewer</b> window open, but do one of the following:
	-	Switch NTV2Watcher to an Inspector other than the \ref inspectoranc, or…
	-	Stop viewing “Packets” and instead switch to “Raw” or “Hide” in the \ref inspectoranc, or…
	-	Uncheck the <b>Polling</b> checkbox at the top of the main window.

<b>Generating Captions</b>

This tool can also generate caption byte pairs by using the controls at the bottom of the tool window:
	-	<b>Type</b> — This controls the type of caption to generate:
		-	<b>PopOn</b> — This uses the CNTV2CaptionEncoder608::EnqueuePopOnMessage function.
		-	<b>RollUp2</b> — This uses the CNTV2CaptionEncoder608::EnqueueRollUpMessage function to produce two-row “roll-up” captions.
		-	<b>RollUp3</b> — This uses the CNTV2CaptionEncoder608::EnqueueRollUpMessage function to produce three-row “roll-up” captions.
		-	<b>RollUp4</b> — This uses the CNTV2CaptionEncoder608::EnqueueRollUpMessage function to produce four-row “roll-up” captions.
		-	<b>PaintOn</b> — This uses the CNTV2CaptionEncoder608::EnqueuePaintOnMessage function.
	-	<b>Row</b> spin control — specifies the row number where the caption text will appear.
	-	<b>Col</b> spin control — specifies the column number where the caption text will begin.
	-	<b>FG</b> — Specifies the foreground color of the caption text.
	-	<b>BG</b> — Specifies the background color of the caption text.
	-	<b>Ital</b> checkbox — If checked, the caption text should be italicized.
	-	<b>Undr</b> checkbox — If checked, the caption text should be underlined.
	-	<b>Blnk</b> checkbox — If checked, the caption text should blink.
	-	Transparency popup menu — Choose from <b>Opaque</b>, <b>Translucent</b> or <b>Transparent</b>.
	-	<b>Text</b> box — Enter the caption text to be generated.
	-	Click <b>Xmit</b> to generate and “transmit” the caption byte pairs.
		These will be DMA’d starting at the current frame’s F1 Anc or VANC region (in the \ref inspectoranc).
		It will continue pulling byte pairs from the FIFO and DMA’ing into subsequent frame buffers on the device.

@subsection	memmapdlog		“Memory Map” Tool

@image	html	watcher-tool-memmap.png

The <b>Memory Map</b> is a handy debugging aid for visualizing how device memory is being used.
It can readily indicate \ref vidop-fbconflict and/or \ref audioclobber.

-	The top of the window has two indicators:
	-	<b>Intrinsic Frame Size</b> — indicates the “natural” size of a non-4K, non-8K frame, in megabytes.
		This is what the hardware is using for normal, non-4K/8K frames.
	-	<b>Total SDRAM</b> — displays the total SDRAM complement of the device, in megabytes.
-	The remainder of the window contains the <b>Memory Map</b>:
	-	The horizontal space represents the device’s addressable SDRAM storage:
		-	Address zero (0x00000000) is at the far left edge;
		-	The highest addressable byte is at the far right edge.
	-	The vertical space is irrelevant.
	-	<b>Scrolling</b> — When needed, scroll bars are provided to allow scrolling offscreen areas of the Map into view.
	-	<b>Zoom Controls</b> — Click <b>+</b> to zoom in;  click <b>−</b> to zoom out.
	-	Memory Region objects:
		-	<b>Frame</b> — The gray boxes represent the intrinsic 8MB or 16MB frame boundaries.
			-	The numeric labels show the zero-based frame number.
			-	Each frame represents a specific, unique byte range in device memory. No two frames ever overlap.
			-	The width indicates the device’s <b>Intrinsic Frame Size</b>. At this time, NTV2 devices use an
				intrinsic frame size of either 8MB or 16MB.
			-	Double-click to open the \ref inspectorframebuffer and view the raw frame data.
			-	Right-click for a context menu:
				-	<b>Inspect</b> — opens the \ref inspectorframebuffer to view the raw frame data.
		-	<b>AutoCirculate</b> — These translucent boxes span multiple Frames, and represents the frames being used
			by an \ref aboutautocirculate channel.
			-	Color depends on the Channel video format: green for SD, purple for HD, etc.
			-	Label identifies the Mode and Channel (e.g. “In1", “Out2”, etc.).
			-	When in <b>Quad Mode</b> (4K/UHD) or <b>Quad-Quad Mode</b> (8K/UHD2), the logical frame size is 4 or 16 times
				(respectively) the device’s intrinsic frame size.
			-	Double-click to open the \ref inspectorac.
			-	Right-click for a context menu:
				-	<b>Inspect</b> — opens the \ref inspectorac.
				-	<b>Stop</b> — stops the channel.
				-	<b>Pause</b> — pauses the channel.
				-	<b>Resume</b> — resumes the channel.
			-	Drag to change the channel’s frame range (it will be restarted).
		-	<b>Video Read</b> — (Green) — Represents the “Output Frame” being read by an enabled FrameStore.
			-	Labeled with the FrameStore’s channel number (e.g. “1”, “2”, etc.).
			-	In memory, NTV2 FrameStore widgets (see \ref vidop-fs ) always read video starting at the frame boundary
				(at the lowest address).
			-	The width of the box indicates how much memory is being read by the FrameStore.
			-	Double-click to open the \ref inspectorframebuffer and view the frame image.
			-	Right-click for a context menu:
				-	<b>Inspect</b> — opens the \ref inspectorframebuffer to view the frame image.
				-	<b>Disable</b> — disables (turns off) the FrameStore.
			-	Drag to interactively change the FrameStore’s “Output Frame”.
		-	<b>Video Write</b> — (Red) — Represents the “Input Frame” being written by an enabled FrameStore.
			-	Labeled with the FrameStore’s channel number (e.g. “1”, “2”, etc.).
			-	In memory, NTV2 FrameStore widgets (see \ref vidop-fs ) always write video starting at the frame boundary
				(at the lowest address).
			-	The width of the box indicates how much memory is being written by the FrameStore.
			-	Double-click to open the \ref inspectorframebuffer and view the frame image.
			-	Right-click for a context menu:
				-	<b>Inspect</b> — opens the \ref inspectorframebuffer to view the frame image.
				-	<b>Disable</b> — disables (turns off) the FrameStore.
			-	Drag to interactively change the FrameStore’s “Input Frame”.
		-	<b>Audio Read</b> — (Green) — Represents the playout audio buffer being read during \ref audioplayout .
			-	Labeled with the Audio System (e.g. “A1", “A2”, etc.).
			-	Double-click to open the \ref inspectoraudio and reveal the audio buffer’s contents.
			-	Right-click for a context menu:
				-	<b>Inspect</b> — opens the \ref inspectoraudio to reveal the audio buffer’s contents.
				-	<b>Stop Playback</b> — stops the audio system’s playback engine.
		-	<b>Audio Write</b> — (Red) — Represents the capture audio buffer being written during \ref audiocapture .
			-	Labeled with the Audio System (e.g. “A1", “A2”, etc.).
			-	Double-click to open the \ref inspectoraudio and reveal the audio buffer’s contents.
			-	Right-click for a context menu:
				-	<b>Inspect</b> — opens the \ref inspectoraudio to reveal the audio buffer’s contents.
				-	<b>Stop Recording</b> — stops the audio system’s record/capture engine.
		-	You can <b>hover</b> over any object to display a tooltip that contains detailed information about the region.

To close the <b>Memory Map</b> tool window:
	-	click its close box;
	-	or un-check the <b>View</b> menu’s <b>Memory Map</b> command.

@subsection	scraptool		“Scrap Buffer” Tool

@image	html	watcher-tool-scrap.png

The <b>Scrap Buffer</b> is a handy debugging aid for viewing the contents of the host operating system’s “desk scrap”
buffer (aka “clipboard” or “paste buffer”). It can also display the contents of files dropped into the window.

-	It periodically monitors for scrap changes and updates automatically.
-	The top of the window shows the number of bytes being viewed.
-	The remainder of the window displays the data.
	-	<b>Data View Options</b> — (Right-Click Operations)
		-	<b>Grouping</b> — Changes the data grouping to 8-bit (1-byte), 16-bit (2-byte), 32-bit (4-byte) or 64-bit (8-byte).
		-	<b>Radix</b> — Changes the radix of the data to Binary, Octal, Decimal or Hexadecimal.
		-	<b>Bytes/Line</b> — Changes the number of bytes to display in each line of the data view.
			Choose from 8 bytes up to 8K bytes by powers of 2.
			Note that larger values make for fewer lines and many more columns.
			Smaller values show many more lines with fewer columns.
	-	<b>Row & Column Label Options</b> — (Right-Click Operations)
		-	<b>Reference</b> — Choose “Byte Offset From Start” or “Byte Offset From End”.
		-	<b>Radix</b> — Choose “Binary”, “Octal”, “Decimal” or “Hexadecimal”.
-	<b>Drag and Drop</b> — Dropping a single file or text clipping from outside the tool window is supported.
	-	The file’s raw contents are displayed in the window.
	-	Viewing a file or clipping stops host scrap/clipboard monitoring.
		To resume host scrap/clipboard monitoring, click “Monitor Clipboard" button (or close and re-open the tool).

To close the <b>Scrap Buffer</b> tool window:
	-	click its close box;
	-	or un-check the <b>View</b> menu’s <b>Scrap Buffer</b> command.
