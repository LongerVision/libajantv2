//	@brief		This is the canonical list of "CanDo" functions (those device-features functions that return true/false).
//	@detail		To add a new function:
//				1)	Add a new line
//				2)	In the new line, add the following (left-to-right order)...
//					a)	Function name
//					b)	Whitespace (required if return value description included)
//					c)	Optional return value description. (Used in Doxy-tagged "@return" comments.)
//
//	@note		Order is irrelevant -- the script sorts everything itself.
